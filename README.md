# KMMComposeTemplate
This is a template for creating Android/iOS Jetpack Compose apps.
# Build
Set gradle JDK version to 17. To build the (unmaintained) UIKit version run `./gradlew iosCompose:iosDeployIPhone13ProDebug`. This may be neccesary to do first in order to build the Compose version. To build the compose version, open the project in XCode on a Mac (I am using an M1 Air) and press the "Play" button.
